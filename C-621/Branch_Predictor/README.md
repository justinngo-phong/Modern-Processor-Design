#Project 1: Implementing gShare branch prediction and evaluating its performance
##Team members 
Justin Ngo, Vamsi Kolla

## Project Description
This project is intended to be a comprehensive introduction to branch predictors.
There are 3 branch predictor implementations: two-bit counters, tournament, and
gShare. There are also 3 branch traces created using ML/AI that can be used to 
evaluate the performance of each branch predictor.

## To make and run
- make clean
- make
- ./Main {trace-file-name}
